# open_ai_GPT3_demo

This project was to build an excercise tracking application with Python and Google Sheets. This will track workouts including distances, time and how many colories burned. 
The inspiration for this came from the GPT3 Open Ai model that uses powerful natural language processing. 

This means that app can take as an input normal English sentence for example the input asks Tell me what excercises you did?: "I ran 5k and cycled for 20 min"
The app will log these activities as will understand that one of the activities was running and one cycling and calculated out duration based on distance and calories.


1) Setup API credentials and Google spreadsheet
2) Get excercise stats with Natural Language Queries
3) Set up Google Sheet with Sheety
4) Save data into Google sheets
5) Autheticate Sheety API
6) Environment variables
